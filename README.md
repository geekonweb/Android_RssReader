Android_RssReader
=================

This project is a client for Feedly.

It is a typical Rss Reader client which used to support Google Reader.

Since GR closed by Google, Feedly is a alternative choice to instead GR.

As usual, it is a full function client.

Google account system is used to get authentication token.

Sync from Feedly will get items, subscriptions, tags from server.

Sync to Feedly will sync offline operations to server.

All status like AsRead, AsUnread, Star etc are supported.

In most rss feed, they will not output all content in article, only abstract are available.

I had developed a Readablility method to generate readable content just by double click.

UTF is the default encoding in feed website for generation, gb2312 is also in support lists.

Social sharing is using third-part solution named 'ShareSDK', thanks for their great works.

It also support offline download. Two polices are by period and by fixed time.

A new render engine is used to re-render content for small screen in mobile phones.

It will reformat all styles, fonts, links and line-height.

It also use html5 video and other multi-media application for replace Flash.
